# Mini App Frontend - Technical Test

This is a frontend application built using Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript, and Pinia for state management. The app also integrates TailwindCSS for styling.

## Application Overview

This web application provides a user-friendly responsive interface for managing nurseries and children within those nurseries. The key functionalities include:

### 1. User Authentication
- Users are prompted to log in with a username.
- If the username does not exist, users are prompted to register with an email.
- The authenticated userâ€™s session is maintained and displayed in the page header.

### 2. Nursery Management
- A list of nurseries is displayed, allowing users to view, create, and delete nurseries.
- Users can navigate to a detailed page for each nursery.

### 3. Child Management
- On each nursery's detail page, users can view the list of children assigned to the nursery.
- Users can add new children to the nursery or remove their assignments.

### 4. Child Data Export
- Users can export child data to a CSV file.
- The export can include all children across all nurseries or only those associated with a specific nursery.
- Data is streamed to avoid performance issues with large datasets.

This application is designed to handle user authentication, nursery and child management, and data export efficiently through a streamlined and intuitive interface.
